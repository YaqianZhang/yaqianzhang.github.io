I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg). I'm currently working on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to facilitate human-computer interaction. Here is my [CV](about/document.pdf).Before coming to Singapore, I got my Bachelor degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), in 2015.
