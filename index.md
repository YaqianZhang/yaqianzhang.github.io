# Welcome to Yaqian's homepage!
## Bio

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg). Before coming to Singapore, I got my Bachelor degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), in 2015. I'm currently working on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to facilitate human-computer interaction.

## Research Interests
*   Reinforcement Learning
*   Machine Learning
*   Human Computer Interaction

## News
* [Aug.2019]  Submitted Ph.D. thesis for review.
* [Dec.2018]  A paper accepted at AAMAS'19

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
