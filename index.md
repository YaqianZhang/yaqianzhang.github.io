# Welcome to my homepage!
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg). I'm currently working on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to facilitate human-computer interaction. Here is my [CV](about/document.pdf). Before coming to Singapore, I got my Bachelor degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), in 2015. 

## Research
My goal is to develop efficient machine learning algorithms to faciliate high-quality interation experience in interative systems. One idea we've explored is to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to autonomously adjust the difficulty levels for the users. A key challenge of applying RL to interactive systems is sample efficiency.  
We shows that the sample efficiency of policy gradient can be significantly improved by bootstrapping it with better/worse action sets ([AAMAS 2019](papers/19_YaqianZhang_BootstrappedPolicyGradient_aamas.pdf)). This finding makes policy gradient methods applicable in chanllenging environments with large action space and short exploration horizon.

The fundamental questions regarding traditional Machine Learning (ML) research also fascinates me. On this note, we proposed a simple yet powerful method for detection of cluster number. Specifically,  we showed that the curvature informaiton can be used to detect the "knee/elbow" point of the evaluation graph in a precise way ([Information Sciences](papers/17_YaqianZhang_Curvature_Cluster_InformationScience.pdf)). Despiste low computational complexity, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-art methods and achieves robust performance for complex datasets.

I'm also interested in achieving a deeper understanding of human behavior. To this end, I've employed a inter-displinary research method, to design practical gaming systems([a multiplay game](_posts/2018-02-16-peer-accountability-on-attention.md),[an online game](_posts/2018-06-30-difficulty-adjustment-for-visual-memory-training.md)) and conduct online and offline user studies. New insights on effects of gameplay design elments on the users' selective attention has been obtained. ([Computers in Human Behavior](papers/18_YaqianZhang_PeerAccountability_CHB.pdf) ).
