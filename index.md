# Welcome to Yaqian's homepage!


I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg). Before coming to Singapore, I got my Bachelor degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), in 2015. I'm currently working on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to facilitate human-computer interaction. Here is my [CV](about/document.pdf).

## Research Interests
*   Reinforcement Learning
*   Machine Learning
*   Human Computer Interaction

## News
* [Aug.2019]  Submitted Ph.D. thesis for review.
* [Dec.2018]  A paper accepted at AAMAS'19
