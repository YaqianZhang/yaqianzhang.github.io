# Welcome to my homepage!
I'm a Research Assitant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I obtained a PhD in Compputer Science from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg) in 2020. I'm currently working on developing efficient reinforcement learning algorithms to facilitate human-computer interaction.  Before coming to Singapore, I got my Bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 2015. Here is my [CV](about/CV_Yaqian_Zhang.pdf).

## Research
I am particularly interested in developing statistically and computationally efficient machine learning algorithms which are applicable for real-world systems. 
To improve the sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, one idea I've explored is to bootstrap policy gradient with better/worse actions. This leads to fast and unbiased convergence in challenging environments with large action space and short horizon (e.g. intelligent tutoring system) ([AAMAS 2019](papers/19_YaqianZhang_BootstrappedPolicyGradient_aamas.pdf)).
To reduce the computational cost in cluster analysis, I proposed to exploit curvature information of the evaluation graph. This results in  a simple yet powerful method for estimating the number of clusters in a dataset ([Information Sciences 2017](papers/17_YaqianZhang_Curvature_Cluster_InformationScience.pdf)).
I'm also interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems. On this note, I've employed an interdisciplinary research method, to design and implement practical gaming systems ([a multiplayer game](_posts/2018-02-16-peer-accountability-on-attention.md),  [an online game](_posts/2018-06-30-difficulty-adjustment-for-visual-memory-training.md)) and conduct online and offline user studies ([Computers in Human Behavior 2018](papers/18_YaqianZhang_PeerAccountability_CHB.pdf)).


**Research Interests**: Reinforcement Learning; Machine Learning; Human-Computer Interaction.
